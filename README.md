# The Smell of Coffee in the Morning

**The idea**:  
Everybody likes waking up to the smell of coffee. Nobody would want to wake up
without it, given a choice. Now, with as little effort as possible, you can
have this every day â€“ Just buy an Arduino, a Raspberry Pi, a 16-key keypad, an
PCD8544 based LCD, and some 5v relays... oh, and a coffee maker! You'll be
waking up happy 'till the end of your days.

**Development notice**:  
Moving from Arduino+Pi-based design to Pi-only design. To check out the (mostly
working) work on Arduino, see the `arduino` branch.
